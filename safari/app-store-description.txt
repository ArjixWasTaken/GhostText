Use your text editor to write in your browser. Everything you type in the editor will be instantly updated in the browser (and vice versa).

Whenever you’re writing more than a little snippet of code anywhere on the web, activate GhostText to open your preferred text editor and enjoy your own development environment.

GhostText is a browser extension that connects to your editor via its own extension. Install both extensions and, if necessary, start the GhostText server in the editor’s extension.

Supported editors:

• Sublime Text
• VS Code
• Atom
• Emacs
• Vim
