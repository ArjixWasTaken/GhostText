# Contributing

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or later is required.

## Workflow

First clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fregante/GhostText
cd GhostText
npm install
```

When working on the extension or checking out branches, use this to have it constantly build your changes:

```sh
# Build once
npm run build

# or listen to file changes and automatically rebuild
npm run watch
```

Then load or reload it into the browser to see the changes.

## Loading into the browser

The built extension will be in the `distribution` folder.

- [Load it manually in Chrome](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#google-chrome-opera-vivaldi)
- [Load it manually in Firefox](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#mozilla-firefox)

Or use [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) to load it automatically and watch for updates:

```sh
# Install tool globally
npm install -g web-ext
```

```sh
# Run extension in Chrome
web-ext run --target=chromium
```

```sh
# Run extension in Firefox
web-ext run
```

## Adding support for more editors

"Support" is made of 2 parts:

- [detection]([url](https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/a3ac72db5c05edbe0d4e2cef70c1a4fd5cdfd11b/source/ghost-text.js#L71-L88)) (it _could_ be URL-based if it's a custom editor, but ideally it's attribute-based)
- text read/write

If the value an be set via DOM, like for a standard `contentEditable`, the second point would be easy:

https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/febe6a66146cd3e620ad4458e50954e213bbb629/source/ghost-text.js#L14-L30

In the more likely case where you have to access the websiteâ€™s own script data, you'd have to go through the `AdvancedTextWrapper`, which communicates with the [`unsafe-messenger` script](https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/main/source/unsafe-messenger.js) to get and set the text:

https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/febe6a66146cd3e620ad4458e50954e213bbb629/source/unsafe-messenger.js#L35-L51


You can see the above piece of code uses a local `CodeMirror` property and then sends the value via events.
